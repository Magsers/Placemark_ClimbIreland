# Placemark
 
This is an app developed for climbers in Ireland who want to keep a record of the routes they have climbed in different crags around the country.
Currently there are numerous guidebooks for the different crags such as :

The Burren
Fairhead
Glendalough
Donegal
Gap of Dunloe
Dunsheen
and more... With the development of Placemark climbers can add one of these crags to their profile and add the route they climbed with the grade, the climber who made the first ascent, the diffiuclty grade, the height and a brief description of the route.
Basic functionality will be achieved with Version 1 where users can sign up, create a user profile, add, edit and delete crags and routes.
An admin account will be created to ensure users can be deleted. Exhaustive unit testing is carried out throughout the process of development.
